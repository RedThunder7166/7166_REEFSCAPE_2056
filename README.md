# 7166 Reefscape 2056 robot

This is the repository for Red Thunder Robotics' Reefscape offseason robot. We built 2056 OP Robotics' 2025 robot and here is our code for it.

This was written by one Senior on the team. I have yet to learn AdvantageKit so simulation and such is lacking.

This is based directly off of AdvantageKit's example swerve drive project.

The formatting plugin made me angry. I am not caring about licenses in files so they're super inconsistent.
